          <h2>The Honorable Lord Stefan li Rous</h2>
          <subtitle>Pulled from his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240816014607/https://www.joincake.com/memorial-pages/mark-harris/#obituary">Obituary</a></subtitle>
          <p>
            Mark Stephen Harris was born in Dallas, Texas, on August 26, 1957. He left this world on Friday, June 10, 2022, at the age of 64 from North Austin Medical Center. 
            We miss him.
          </p>
        <p>
One of Mark’s passions was his membership in the local barony of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). Interesting, right? that someone so knowledgeable about modern computers loved learning and practicing the technology of medieval times. Mark collected and tried different recipes from ye olden days, seeking to use authentic ingredients and methods. He made his own chain mail and participated in medieval combat, including jousting tournaments.
</p>
<p>
Mark, a.k.a. Stefan Li Rous, met his wife, Alice Morrow, a.k.a. Alina Mitchell, through the SCA. During their marriage, they traveled across the country several times to SCA “wars,” which were huge meet-ups with other SCA groups where they could share knowledge through demonstrations and classes, compete in sporting events, and live the medieval life in a big campground for a few days.  
</p>
<p>
Mark loved animals, too, and had several cats and dogs over the years. Two of his favorite dogs, Snowball and Caspar, marched in many a Fourth of July parade and SCA event, pulling a small medieval-style cart.
</p>
<p>
Mark was fairly adventurous about food, although he couldn’t remember a green vegetable that he liked. He was also a good sport when the family met at noisy, crowded local Mexican restaurants to celebrate Father’s Day and birthdays. Mark was kind and generous.
